            <br><h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>Lexy is a 21-year-old business student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. She is in her last year of school and is excited to graduate with a bachelor's degree in business administration with a concentration in management. Lexy started her academic career at Metropolitan Community College after being granted a full ride scholarship. This is one of her accomplishments that she is most proud of. This set the basis of her schooling and allowed for her success at her current university. In the near future, she hopes to grow her career in hospitality and potentially get her real estate license. She also is planning on moving out and buying a house with her girlfriend to start this new chapter of her life. In the long run it is a major goal to travel to every state in the country at least once. She has visited many different places already, but by far her favorite place to visit is Colorado Springs, Colorado.  After traveling, she hopes to settle down in a lifelong house and start a family. Lexy spends most of her time at school or working at the Even Hotel in downtown Omaha as a front office supervisor. She is very appreciative of the opportunities that this job has provided for her and the skills she has learned along the way. When she is not working or in school, she also enjoys shopping, specifically at Target and TJMaxx. Recently, Lexy has learned to crochet and is really enjoying creating different projects for people in her life. These people include her 6 year old sister, Libby and her 15 year old brother, Luke. </p>
